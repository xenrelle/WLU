# WLU
The gay relationship between Windows and Unix (Windows loving Unix)

## What the fuck is this
I don't know I thought it'd be fun to port Windows shit to Linux and Linux shit to Windows, mainly terminal commands from each OS but I plan on making open-source recreations of application on either OS that can compile to either.

## Why?
idk, thought it was a funny idea
