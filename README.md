# WLU
The gay relationship between Windows and Unix (Windows loving Unix)

## What the fuck is this
I don't know I thought it'd be fun to port Windows shit to Linux and Linux shit to Windows, mainly terminal commands from each OS but I plan on making open-source recreations of application on either OS that can compile to either.

This repository contains tons of subdirectories containing applications with their own build instructions.

Hopefully this proves to help someone familiar with Linux to use Windows and vice versa.

(might work on MacOS too since i heard macos is unix based but i dont have a Mac so i cant test lmao)

## Why?
Why not?

## What does this repo contain?
In the `linux` subdirectory, it contains Linux equivalents of Windows applications, commands, and other shit like that.
Likewise, in the `windows` subdirectory, it contains Windows equivalents of Linux apps, commands, etc.

Basically I just like the idea of both OSes having equality.

Each module will contain build instructions, a description, and a rating on how accurate it is. I'm a huge sucker for accuracy.

## How can I get this?
For now, you'll need to compile everything manually, as this is nowhere near stable enough to provide pre-built binaries.

## How do I compile this?
There isn't a way to really compile the entire repository, since it's split between two OSes and is designed to be modular, but you can pick which applications/commands you want and compile them manually! Each module has its own build instructions in its README.md

## Other Name Candidates
- WoL (Windows on Linux, referencing the SysWOW64 folder in Windows)
- WALL (Windows Absolutely LOVES Linux, reference to WINE and supporting my Windows x Linux fanfinction, also funny house component (Windows on Walls))
- Winux (a gay couple name idk)
