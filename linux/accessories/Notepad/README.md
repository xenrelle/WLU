# Notepad ![Accuracy Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Accuracy-3/5_(Getting_There)-yellow)
Just plain ol' Notepad.

## Functions
Acts as a simple text editor. This version contains a dark mode because I felt like that'd be a nice addition.

## Build Instructions
You'll need `qt5-base` installed in order to build this. Then just build it like so:
```bash
qmake
make
```
