# cls

It's, exactly what you think it is. Just cls. However, just like the real Windows cls, it prints that ugly newline on top of the screen after wiping the console output!

## Build Instructions
You'll need `gcc` installed in order to build this. Then just build it like normal:
```bash
gcc -o cls main.c
```

If you want to be able to use this everywhere, copy it to `/usr/bin` or add it to the PATH variable.
